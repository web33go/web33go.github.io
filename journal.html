<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
<q>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.
<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar
<q>Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
